Description: # Dutl 
        
        Dutl is a python package to embed and visualize multiple linked transcriptomics experiments with deep unsupervised transfer learning
        
        ***DULT*** is developed in Python, and PyTorch serves as the engine of the deep learning.
        
        It has the following features:  
        
        1. Enables the joint decomposition and embedding of multiple structured transcriptomics datasets;
        
        1. Very Flexible in designing the structure of the neural network; 
        
        1. Provides visualization tools to be used on the embedded low dimension representations;
        
        1. Packaged with metrics to determine the performance of the embedding.
