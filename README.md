# Dutl 

Dutl is a python package to embed and visualize multiple linked transcriptomics experiments with deep unsupervised transfer learning

***DULT*** is developed in Python, and PyTorch serves as the engine of the deep learning.

It has the following features:  

1. Enables the joint decomposition and embedding of multiple structured transcriptomics datasets;

1. Very Flexible in designing the structure of the neural network; 

1. Provides visualization tools to be used on the embedded low dimension representations;

1. Packaged with metrics to determine the performance of the embedding.

For any improvements and issues that need to be addressed, please contact [Huan Chen](hchen130@jhu.edu).
